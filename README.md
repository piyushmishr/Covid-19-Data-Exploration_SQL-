## Skills Applied

- Joins: Utilized to combine data from different tables to enrich the analysis.
- CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Used to create temporary result sets for complex queries.
- Temporary Tables: Employed to store intermediate results for more efficient querying.
- Window Functions: Applied for performing calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row.
- Aggregate Functions: Used to calculate summary statistics like counts, averages, etc.
- Creating Views: Implemented to save frequently used queries as views for easier access.
- Converting Data Types: Ensured data compatibility by transforming data types when necessary.
